## Getting Started

Currently the library is in a fully alpha version, which means that it is not 
optimized or ready to be loaded correctly.

The following files must be included respecting the order:

    src/js/engine/Context.js
    src/js/engine/Draw.js
    src/js/engine/Mouse.js
    src/js/engine/Sprites.js
  
The stylesheet contains hardly any relevant information, 
other than the positioning of the canvas container.

    style.css

This is generated from a Sass compiler from the source file style.scss. 
Currently the styles applied are example styles and we try to keep the 
responsibility for the size to the developer to apply their own customization 
styles.
